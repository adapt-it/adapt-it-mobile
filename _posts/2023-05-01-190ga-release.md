### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.9.0

This release provides support for glossing and free translation editor modes:

#### Gloss editor mode

The gloss editor mode allows you to either create linguistic glosses of the source text for language research / documentation, or to create a literal interlinear gloss or back translation into a third language.

#### Free translation editor mode

The free translation editor allows you to create an idiomatic translation of the target text in order to test the translation's accuracy and readability. 

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Adapt It Mobile now overrides the auto-caps behavior on Android / iOS (#102).

- Added several status and robustness improvements to document import (#479).

- Fixed an issue where users were unable to delete single-chapter documents (#483).

Enhancements and issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/41?closed=1).

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
