### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.16.0

#### Language Selection enhancements

When possible, Adapt It Mobile will display the autonym (native language name) for each language in the source and target language name fields for your translation projects, with the name of the language in English in a secondary line below each suggestion. (#558) If no autonym is available for a language suggestion, only the name of the language in English is displayed.
 
#### Bug fixes and enhancements

- Fixed some issues with the preview display of the Free Translation editor (#565)
- Fixed some display issues with the “start adapting from where you left off” button (#560, 561)
- Set the focus on the book name edit field when document import finishes, so that the user can easily change the book name if desired (#559)
- Fixed an error where only the first character was being searched on the Browse/Search page (#563)
