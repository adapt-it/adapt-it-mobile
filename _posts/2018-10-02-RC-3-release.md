We are pleased to announce the third release candidate for Adapt It Mobile 1.0.

This release contains the following bug fix:

- Fixed an issue where the font selection was not persisting in the project settings > source, target and navigation fonts pages, if the user selected a font other than one of the embedded fonts (#347).

This issue can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/27?closed=1).
