### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.4.0

#### Work with Multiple Adaptation Projects

Adapt It Mobile now supports multiple translation projects. New projects can be created or imported from Adapt It via the new Manage Projects settings page (Settings > Manage Projects); users can switch between translation projects and delete unused projects from the database. 

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Fixed a problem where word and phrase selection was getting inadvertently cleared on some devices (issue #425).

These issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/33?closed=1).

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).

Please refer to the [Adapt It Mobile Wiki site](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/wiki#using-adapt-it-mobile) for instructions on installing. Issues and enhancement requests can be reported through our [issues page](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/issues). Thanks!
