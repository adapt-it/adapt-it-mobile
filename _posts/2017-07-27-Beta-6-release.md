## Release 1.0 beta 6 available for download

We are pleased to announce the sixth public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing.

The main user interface change is to address some problems with the filtered USFM markers on the adaptation screen (see Issue #142). Now when the user clicks on the filter icon, the Filtered Text window appears:

This window has the following elements:

- A title line, with the current index and total number of usfm markers that are being filtered out in the display.
- The current marker being displayed
- The text associated with the filtered marker
- Informational text that states whether the filtered text can be made available for adaptation (text in *red* cannot be made available for adaptation; text in *green* can).
- If there is more than one filtered marker, there are also arrow keys that allow the user to go to the previous / next filtered marker.

A full list of resolved issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/18?closed=1).
