### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.13.0

#### Knowledge Base Editor

Adapt It Mobile can now view and edit the contents of the knowledge base (translation memory). To access the knowledge base editor, click on the Knowledge Base link on the Settings screen. From there, you can:

- View the current entries in the knowledge base
- Search for entries
- Add new entries
- Click on an entry to view or edit the translation â€” or view where the translation is found in the project

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Added functionality to add new translations through the Show Translations screen, available from the More Actions dropdown when a translation is selected in the Adaptation screen.

- Fixed an issue where importing / merging identical data before verse 1 would cause Adapt It Mobile to hang (#520). This issue was found during Key It export testing.

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
