### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.15.0

#### Document export enhancements

Adapt It Mobile can now export to remote storage, including Google Drive and iCloud services. At the end of the export wizard, Adapt It Mobile will display a directory chooser. Here you can select either a local directory or remote service, and Adapt It Mobile will save to the selected location. (issues #545, 273) Note: to export to a remote service, you need to be signed in to the remote service with valid credentials.
 
#### Bug fixes and enhancements

- Fixed an issue where the first copied project file would not return to the Home Screen once the copy process finished (#543)
- Fixed an issue where a failure message during the copy project process was causing the wizard to restart (#547)

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
