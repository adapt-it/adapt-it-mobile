## Release 1.0 beta 10 available for download

We are pleased to announce the tenth public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing:

- Fixed an issue on iOS where clicking on the Return key on the on-screen keyboard would select the next field, but the software keyboard would disappear. (#279)
- Fixed several issues related to scrolling on Android (#280, #277)
- Fixed an issue where the select adaptation drop-down menu was not displaying properly if the user went back and clicked on the target field again. (#283)
- Fixed some issues with the knowledge base integrity (#285)
- Fixed an issue where the last edited field wasn't getting saved when the app went to the background (#276)
- Fixed an issue where a click on the target field was auto-filling and continuing, instead of allowing the user to make corrections (#275)
- Fixed an issue on Android where the edit menu was obscuring the source text (#268)

This milestone also added an internal change to migrate from the Cordova globalization plugin to the ECMA internationalization API (#270).
