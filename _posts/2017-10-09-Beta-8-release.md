## Release 1.0 beta 8 available for download

We are pleased to announce the eighth public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing:

- Fixed an issue where the buttons on the More Actions (...) drop-down menu were not updating correctly (#254).
- Fixed an issue where the selection of multiple words in the editor was selecting words just before the finger / mouse selection. 
- Updated the UI for the Welcome and Get Started screens with a "flat" style, to be more in line with the rest of the application.

A full list of resolved issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/20?closed=1).
