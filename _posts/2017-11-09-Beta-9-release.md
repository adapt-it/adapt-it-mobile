We are pleased to announce the ninth public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing:

- Fixed a runtime permissions issue on Android devices (6.0 and above), where no documents were found when attempting to import a project or document. (#264)
- Fixed a UI issue where a white bar was displaying in the status bar under iOS 11 (#262)
- Fixed an issue on the New Project / Source Language and Target Language steps, where the initial focus on the language name field was causing the instructions to be scrolled offscreen. (#260)
