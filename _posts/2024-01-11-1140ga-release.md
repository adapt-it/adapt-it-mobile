### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.14.0

#### Document Import enhancements

- Adapt It Mobile now displays the file chooser screen for you to select a local or remote file to import. You can also choose to import text from the clipboard or share files from other apps.
- Adapt It Mobile now supports the import of Adapt It desktop project (.aic) files during file import. Note: if you choose to import a project file from the import screen, Adapt It Mobile will create a new translation project, but will not switch to this new project. To switch between projects, Select Settings > Project Management from the main screen.

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
