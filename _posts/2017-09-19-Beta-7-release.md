## Release 1.0 beta 7 available for download

We are pleased to announce the seventh public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing:

- Fixed two XML parsing issues related to reading filtered text from the AI XML document.
- Fixed a display issue with chapter and verse numbers not displaying correctly when followed by a cross reference or some other filtered text.
- Moved the AIM project database to where it can be backed up by iOS, or readily copied via SD card for Android. Note that for iOS, backup to iCloud can be managed or turned off by following the instructions at this link: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207689

A full list of resolved issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/19?closed=1).
