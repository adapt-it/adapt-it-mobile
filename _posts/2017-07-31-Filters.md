## What is filtered text?

USFM, one of the document formats supported by Adapt It Mobile, can contain both **text that needs translation** and **markup information about the text** (translation consultant notes, for example) that should not be translated. Adapt It Mobile *filters* -- or hides -- some of this markup text, so that the user can focus on translating the text. 

In Adapt It Mobile, filtered text is represented by a blue "funnel" icon next to the text being translated:

### Viewing filtered text

To view the filtered text at a specific point in the adaptation, scroll the view to that point and click the Filtered Text icon. A screen similar to the following displays:

This window has the following elements:

- A title line, with the current index and total number of usfm markers that are being filtered out in the display.
- The current marker being displayed
- The text associated with the filtered marker
- Informational text that states whether the filtered text can be made available for adaptation (text in *red* cannot be made available for adaptation; text in *green* can).
- If there is more than one filtered marker, there are also arrow keys that allow the user to go to the previous / next filtered marker.

To move to the previous / next filtered marker, click on the forward / back arrows:

To close the filtered text window, click on either the X icon in the upper right corner of the window or in the darker area outside the window.
