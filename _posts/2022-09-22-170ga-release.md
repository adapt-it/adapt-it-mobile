### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.7.0

#### Restore or Merge Knowledge Base from file

Adapt It Mobile supports restoring or merging the translation memory (Knowledge Base) from either an Adapt It desktop .xml Knowledge Base File or from a Translation Memory Exchange (.tmx) file.

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Fixed an issue where Adapt It Mobile would not give the option of continuing to the next chapter in a document when finished with the current chapter (Issue #462).

These enhancements and issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/39?closed=1).

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
