## Release 1.0 beta 5 available for download

We are pleased to announce the fifth public beta for Adapt It Mobile 1.0. This beta release includes issues found during beta testing, focusing on the usability of the adaptation screen. There are several significant changes to this area of the app:

- [A new combined toolbar / title bar](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/issues/224)
With this change, the document title is hidden, allowing for the action buttons from the toolbar to be displayed in the title bar.

  - On smaller screen widths, the Placeholder, Phrase, and Retranslation buttons are hidden inside a "More actions" button (visually, an ellipsis "...") that functions like a drop-down menu:

  - On screen widths that can display these three buttons, the "More actions" button is replaced by the three buttons directly:

  - On the largest tablet displays, button labels can also be displayed, giving users a better idea of what the buttons do:

- [An "Undo" button](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/issues/225), to deal with the lack of a "Cancel edit" on the software keyboard (e.g., an Esc key). You'll notice it as the circular arrow icon, second to the left in the combined toolbar / title bar.
