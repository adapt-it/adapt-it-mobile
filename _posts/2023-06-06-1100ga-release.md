You can now export gloss and free translation data into USFM, using the Export wizard. This functionality is available when the "Show Gloss and Free Translation Editor" option is checked in the user settings.

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Adapt It Mobile now overrides the auto-caps behavior in the phrase and retranslation fields (#489).

- Added several Spanish punctuations to the default Copy Punctuation character set (#492).

- Added support for Android 13 (API 33) (#491).

Enhancements and issues can be found [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/milestone/42?closed=1).

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
