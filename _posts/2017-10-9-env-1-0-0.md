## cordova-plugin-env initial release 1.0.0

The Adapt It Mobile team members have developed a general purpose plugin for the [Apache Cordova framework](https://cordova.apache.org/) called [cordova-plugin-env](https://github.com/adapt-it/cordova-env). This plugin allows Cordova applications to access various directories on Android mobile devices (for example, the Downloads or Documents directories).

The cordova-plugin-env release 1.0.0 has several utility methods that allow Cordova application developers access to external storage on Android devices:

- getExternalStorageState()
- isExternalStorageEmulated()
- isExternalStorageRemovable()
- getDirectory(string)
