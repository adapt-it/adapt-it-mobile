### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.12.0

#### Knowledge Base import/export enhancements

Adapt It Mobile can now import/export LIFT files, and can export SFM key term files (containing \lx and \ge markers) (#506, #509, #510). With this release, Adapt It can pre-populate the Knowledge Base for your translation projects from the following formats:

- Adapt It Desktop KB (.xml)
- Translation Memory Exchange (.tmx)
- Lexical Interchange Format (.lift)
- SFM key term file (.sfm or .txt)

Note that "round-tripping"--importing, updating, then exporting--is not recommended for TMX and LIFT file formats. Adapt It Mobile is focused on translation between a single source and target language, and does not persist word definitions, etc., so this type of information would be lost when exporting.

#### New / updated embedded fonts

Adapt It Mobile now comes with 7 embedded fonts for a wider range of character support (fonts include Andika, Annapurna, Charis, Doulos, Gentium Plus, Scheherazade New, and Source Sans Pro). You can select these fonts--or any other font installed on your mobile device--to properly display text during translation and translation checking. (#508)

#### Bug Fixes and Various Enhancements

- Fixed an issue where the OK and Cancel buttons were not visible on longer settings screens (#513).

**Known Issues**

- Adapt It Mobile does not currently support collaboration with other translation clients (e.g., with Paratext or other Adapt It Mobile machines). Documents must be imported, translated, and then exported for further processing by other translation clients. Support for collaboration will be implemented in a future release of Adapt It Mobile (issues #8, #11, #59).
