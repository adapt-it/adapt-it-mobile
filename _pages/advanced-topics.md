## Changing the user interface language

Adapt It Mobile supports the following languages for its user interface:

- English
- French
- Spanish
- Tok Pisin

By default, Adapt It Mobile will attempt to use the same user interface language as your device. If Adapt It Mobile doesn't support your device's language, it will fall back on English for its user interface.

**To override this default behavior, complete the following steps:**

1. In Adapt It Mobile's main screen, click on the globe icon in the lower left corner: 

  ![Adapt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/globe.png)

2. In the User Interface Language screen, click on the desired option.

  ![Adapt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/ui-language.png)

  - Click "Use the language specified on this device" to have Adapt It Mobile use the language specified on the device
  - Select a specific language to have Adapt It Mobile override the default settings and always use the language you specify.

3. Click on the OK button to save your changes and return to the main Adapt It Mobile screen. 

***Note on contributing***: If you are interested in localizing Adapt It Mobile's user interface to a language you know, we'd love to work with you! Send us an email at `developers at adapt-it dot org` and let's talk.
