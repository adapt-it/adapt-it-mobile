Adapt It Mobile's primary purpose is to help you quickly and accurately produce draft translations of text, which can then be exported into your favorite tool for further revision and publication. It's able to do this through _adaptation_ and _translation memory_.

## Adaptation

_Adaptation_ is a special case of translation, where the source and target languages are related linguistically (Italian and Spanish, for example). When there is a high degree of similarity in structure - lexical, grammar, discourse, syntax, and morphology - the process of translating between the two languages is easier and can move faster.

## Translation memory

Adapt It Mobile stores the words and phrases you translate in a _translation memory_ on the mobile device. When that word or phrase appears next in the text, Adapt It Mobile "remembers" the previous translation and suggests it for you. You can either use the suggested text or create another as appropriate. If there are multiple translations for a word or phrase, Adapt It Mobile will display the translations in a drop-down menu - again, you can either select one of the previous translations or create a new one as appropriate.

By using a translation memory, Adapt It Mobile speeds up the translation process **and** increases the translation's accuracy - because the previous spelling of the translation is remembered and suggested when the word or phrase appears in the text again.
