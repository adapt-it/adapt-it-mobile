Note that legacy versions 1.0.0 through 1.2.5 of Adapt It Mobile are compatible with Android 4.4.3 or newer. These older versions do not have the latest features or bug fixes, and need to be "side-loaded" by downloading the .apk files directly from [our GitHub source site](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/releases) to your device, and installing them manually. 

## iOS

On Apple devices, Adapt It Mobile is compatible with smartphones and tablets running iOS 11 or newer.
