In addition to creating translation drafts, Adapt It Mobile can also help you create _glosses_ and _free translations_, to help you verify the accuracy of your translations.

## Gloss editor

With Adapt It Mobile's Gloss editor, you can:

- Create word by word or phrase by phrase linguistic glosses of the source text for linguistic research and documentation.
- Create a literal interlinear gloss, a back translation or a free translation of the source text in a third language (usually a regional, trade, or international language).

The glossing editor mode is similar to the adaptation editor mode. The text is laid out with the source text just above the corresponding target text, and the corresponding gloss text just below the target text. As with the adaptation mode editor, Adapt It Mobile maintains a knowledge base (translation memory) of previously entered glosses. These glosses are automatically inserted when the source word is encountered again.

### Free translation editor

Adapt It Mobile also supports the creation of an idiomatic translation of the adapted target text, called a _free translation_.

Free translations are usually created later in the translation cycle to verify a translation’s accuracy. Using both a free translation and a more literal gloss / back translation (a translation from the target language back to the original text), a translation consultant can check the translation’s accuracy and identify areas that need improvement.
