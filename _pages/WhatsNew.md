### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.12.0

#### Knowledge Base import/export enhancements

Adapt It Mobile can now import/export LIFT files, and can export SFM key term files (containing \lx and \ge markers). With this release, Adapt It can pre-populate the Knowledge Base for your translation projects from the following formats:

- Adapt It Desktop KB (.xml)
- Translation Memory Exchange (.tmx)
- Lexical Interchange Format (.lift)
- SFM key term file (.sfm or .txt)

#### New / updated embedded fonts

Adapt It Mobile now comes with 7 embedded fonts for a wider range of character support (fonts include Andika, Annapurna, Charis, Doulos, Gentium Plus, Scheherazade New, and Source Sans Pro). You can select these fonts--or any other font installed on your mobile device--to properly display text during translation and translation checking.
