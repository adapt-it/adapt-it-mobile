### What's new in Adapt It Mobile 1.14.0

#### Document Import enhancements

- Adapt It Mobile now displays the file chooser screen for you to select a local or remote file to import. You can also choose to import text from the clipboard or share files from other apps.
- Adapt It Mobile now supports the import of Adapt It desktop project (.aic) files during file import. Note: if you choose to import a project file from the import screen, Adapt It Mobile will create a new translation project, but will not switch to this new project. To switch between projects, Select Settings > Project Management from the main screen.
