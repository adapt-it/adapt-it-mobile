## What makes Adapt It Mobile different?

### A simple tool, focused on translation

Adapt It Mobile was designed specifically to be used in a mobile device environment:

- Adapt It Mobile was designed to be used offline, with no connectivity needed while translating.
- We've taken care to increase usability on the smallest of screens (as small as 4" for some phones).
- The user interface is designed to be simple and straightforward, with a simple toolbar to indicate the available actions while translating.

- We've included several fonts within the app, to support a wide range of minority languages without having to install extra fonts.

### Powerful Translation

Adapt It Mobile uses the same powerful adaptation engine as the desktop version of Adapt It, rewritten specifically for mobile devices:

As you translate, Adapt It Mobile will remember the words and phrases you use -- and will suggest them the next time the word or phrase is encountered in the text.
