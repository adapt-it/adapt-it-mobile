## A different translation editor

Mobile devices have different characteristics than traditional computers:

- Mobile devices are cheaper than laptop and desktop computers – which can help translation projects to be self-funded by language communities
- In general, mobile devices also use less power – which helps in translation projects where power supply is an issue
- Mobile devices have a smaller screen – the UI has to be simpler and more focused on single tasks
- Mobile devices likely don’t have a hardware keyboard or mouse – this changes the way the UI interaction works

Adapt It Mobile was designed specifically to be used in a mobile device environment:

- Adapt It Mobile was designed to be used offline, with no connectivity needed while translating.
- We've taken care to increase usability on the smallest of screens (as small as 4" for some phones).
- The user interface is designed to be simple and straightforward, with a simple toolbar to indicate the available actions while translating.

- We've included several fonts within the app, to support a wide range of minority languages without having to install extra fonts.
