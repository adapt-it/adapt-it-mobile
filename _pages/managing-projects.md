## Removing a project

If you have completed your work on a project, you can remove it from Adapt It Mobile. Complete the following steps to remove a project. 

**WARNING: this is a non-reversible action. Removing a project will delete the selected project and all its data, including any translation work done on the device. Be sure you have exported the Knowledge Base and all documents before completing this action, so that no translations are lost.**
