# Adapting Issues

<a id="auto-caps"></a>
## Each field is capitalized

Both Android and iOS have system settings that control the capitalization of text input. If you are having problems with the on-screen keyboard automatically capitalizing each word of text, you can turn this feature off for your mobile device:

- On an Android device, go to Settings / Language & Input / Keyboard & input methods; you will need to open the preferences of your selected keyboard and check for a preference labeled "auto capitalization"
- on an iOS device, go to Settings / General / Keyboard and select "Auto-Capitalization"
