## Adapting tips and tricks

Following are some tips that might help in adapting the text more efficiently.

### Keyboards and suggestions

* The **default keyboard** is often set to the locale where your mobile device was purchased. There are several keyboard replacement apps available on the Apple Store and Google Play Store, some of which are free. One option is the excellent [Keyman app](https://keyman.com) for iOS and Android. These keyboard replacements will enable you to set up a keyboard with the characters in your target language.

* **Turn off auto suggestions** on your keyboard. The words that are given in the suggestions are most likely in a different language than you'll be using. To disable suggestions on your phone, follow these instructions:

  * [iOS](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/26/how-to-customize-hide-or-remove-quicktype-suggestions-with-the-ios-8-keyboard)

<a id="auto-caps"></a>

## Each field is capitalized

Both Android and iOS have system settings that control the capitalization of text input. If you are having problems with the on-screen keyboard automatically capitalizing each word of text, you can turn this feature off for your mobile device:

- On an Android device, go to Settings / Language & Input / Keyboard & input methods; you will need to open the preferences of your selected keyboard and check for a preference labeled "auto capitalization"
- on an iOS device, go to Settings / General / Keyboard and turn off "Auto-Capitalization"

## My translations get auto-corrected

Both Android and iOS have system settings that control the auto-correction of text input. Normally this is helpful for entering text in your mobile device, but with Adapt It Mobile you are probably working in a language that isn't directly supported by your device. If you are having problems with the on-screen keyboard automatically correcting each word of text -- to a language you aren't translating to -- you can turn this feature off for your mobile device:

- On an Android device, go to Settings / Language & Input / Keyboard & input methods; you will need to open the preferences of your selected keyboard and check for a preference labeled "Auto-correction." Make sure this setting is turned off.
- on an iOS device, go to Settings / General / Keyboard and turn off "Auto-Correction"

## I have a CUT/COPY/PASTE menu over my text

Both Android and iOS have a system menu that allows you to cut, copy, and paste text like you can on a computer. This menu is displayed when you press and hold your finger on the mobile device screen (what's known as a "long click"). This can be useful when copying text between fields or apps on your device, but it can also block you from seeing the text on your screen.

If you get stuck with this menu over your text, you can perform the following steps to dismiss the menu.

- On Android 5, the menu appears at the top of the screen. To dismiss it, click on the Left arrow in the menu bar.
- On Android versions 6 and newer, click on the `COPY` button to dismiss the menu.
- On iOS, click again on the text edit field to dismiss the menu.
