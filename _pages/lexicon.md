Adapt It Mobile can also help you collect lexical data that can be used to create a dictionary. You can also import lexical data into Adapt It Mobile's translation memory.

## Create and export lexical data

As you translate words and phrases into the target language, Adapt It Mobile stores the translations in a translation memory (called a Knowledge Base). Here's an example Knowledge Base, taken after translating just 4 chapters of the book of John from Catalan to Spanish. You'll note that there are over 700 entries already:

![Example Knowledge Base]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kb-main.png)

Once several books have been translated, this translation memory can contain valuable lexical data that can be exported into tools such as [SIL FieldWorks Language Explorer](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/) and used as the basis for a dictionary in the target language.

## Import lexical data

If your translation team already has lexical data, for example from a [Rapid Word Collection](https://rapidwords.net/) workshop, you can export the collected data to a LIFT format file and then import the file into Adapt It Mobile. The translation memory (Knowledge Base) will then be pre-filled with entries that can be used to translate literacy materials, Scriptures, etc.
