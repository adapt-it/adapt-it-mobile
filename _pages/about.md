## What does it do?
Using a tablet or smartphone, you can use Adapt It Mobile to translate text from one language to another related language - a process called [adaptation](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/wiki/Translation-and-Adaptation). Previous translations are stored in a [translation memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_memory) called a _Knowledge Base_, and are suggested the next time that particular word or phrase is encountered. This can help you quickly create a draft text that can be exported for further revision and publication.

## Two programs, one goal
The Adapt It team has created two programs that enable you to adapt text from one language to another. The [desktop version of Adapt It](http://adapt-it.org/) has been used in translation projects for over a decade now, and is still actively maintained by its developers.

Adapt It Mobile is a ground-up rewrite of the desktop version, written -- by the same developers -- specifically for mobile devices. Mobile devices have different characteristics than traditional computers, and that has shaped how Adapt It Mobile is designed:

- **Mobile devices are cheaper than laptop and desktop computers** -- which can help translation projects to be self-funded by language communities
- **In general, mobile devices also use less power** -- which helps in translation projects where power supply is an issue
- **Mobile devices have a smaller screen** -- the UI has to be simpler and more focused on single tasks
- **Mobile devices likely don't have a hardware keyboard or mouse** -- this changes the way the UI interaction works

Following is a feature comparison chart that helps explain the differences between the two programs.
