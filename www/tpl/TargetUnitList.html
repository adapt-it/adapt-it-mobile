{{! TargetUnitList.html
    Template for rendering the source phrases that match the search or book dropdown lists on the lookup page.
    Each chapter is rendered with a status (number of verses translated), along with a link to adapt that chapter.
    This template is compiled by ChapterListView.js and called from LookupView.js.
    Note: negative versecounts indicate plain text documents; for this case, the versecount is the # of 
    sourcephrases in the document.
