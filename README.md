Adapt It Mobile is a **simple related language translation editor** designed specifically for mobile devices. Using a tablet or smartphone, you can use Adapt It Mobile to quickly translate text from one language to another related language. Previous translations are stored in a translation memory called a _Knowledge Base_, and are suggested the next time that particular word or phrase is encountered.

Adapt It Mobile is a ground-up rewrite of the [Adapt It desktop application](http://adapt-it.org/), written -- by the same developers -- specifically for mobile devices.

## System Requirements

- Android tablet or smart phone running Android 4.4.x or later (5.0 or later preferred - Android's got some bugs in the 4.x version)
- Apple iPad, iPod or iPhone running iOS 9.x or later

## Philosophy

Adapt It Mobile is a free open source tool for quickly translating between related languages. We seek to create, as a community, an adaptation tool that will run on all major mobile platforms and facilitate translation of plain text and [USFM](http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/about/usfm) text, and support collaboration between other translation tools such as the desktop version of [Adapt It](http://adapt-it.org/) as well as [UBS Paratext](http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/) and [Bibledit](https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/).
