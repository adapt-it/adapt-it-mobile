Adapt It Mobile is a **simple related language translation editor** designed specifically for mobile devices. Using a tablet or smartphone, you can use Adapt It Mobile to quickly translate text from one language to another related language. Previous translations are stored in a translation memory called a _Knowledge Base_, and are suggested the next time that particular word or phrase is encountered. All data is stored in a local SQLite database, but can be exported into any of the [supported file formats](https://adapt-it.github.io/adapt-it-mobile/working-with-documents/#supported-file-types).

Adapt It Mobile is a ground-up rewrite of the [Adapt It desktop application](http://adapt-it.org/), written -- by the same developers -- specifically for mobile devices.

## Philosophy

Adapt It Mobile is a free open source tool for quickly translating between related languages. We seek to create, as a community, an adaptation tool that will run on all major mobile platforms and facilitate translation of plain text and [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) text, and support collaboration between other translation tools such as the desktop version of [Adapt It](https://adapt-it.org/) as well as [Paratext](https://paratext.org/) and [Bibledit](https://bibledit.org/).
